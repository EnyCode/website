If you've never heard of Crafti, that's probably because I just created it.

Basically, it's a Minecraft client. What differs it from others is that, instead of just modifying the original game, Crafti is a complete rewrite in a different programming language.
The use of Rust will allow it to run much faster and more efficiently than the base game.

I have a 5 key goals in mind for this project:

- ⏩️ **Speed** - Crafti should be faster than the original game.
- 📦 **Modularity** - Crafti should be easy to modify and extend.
- 📡 **Multiplayer** - Crafti should be able to connect to multiplayer servers.
- 🧩️ **Compatibility** - Crafti should be able to run most mods and resource packs made for the original game.
- ❌️ **Cross Version** - Crafti should be able to connect to servers running different versions of the game, ranging from 1.8 to the lastest version.

Of course, some of these, mainly compatibility with mods, will come much later in the project lifetime.

## Why?

Well, why not?
But there's more to it than that. I'm diving into this (very long) project because I want to embark on a journey to explore Minecraft's insides, getting started with 📡 networking, aswell as testing my commitment to a project.
Aswell as this, Minecraft's codebase hasn't exactly aged well...

When it was first crafted, Minecraft wasn't the same massive game it is today.
It was a tiny game, made by a single person, and it was written in Java.
However, as Minecraft has grown and expanded over the years, its codebase has slowed down to a 🐢 crawl.

So now, it's time for something completely new.

## How can I help?

I'm glad you asked!

Crafti is a massive project, and I can't do it alone.
